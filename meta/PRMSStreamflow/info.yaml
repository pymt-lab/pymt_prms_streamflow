summary: |
  The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Precipitation-Runoff Modeling
  System (PRMS) is a deterministic, distributed-parameter, physical
  process based modeling system developed to evaluate the response of
  various combinations of climate and land use on streamflow and
  general watershed hydrology. This version of PRMS has been
  refactored from PRMS v6.0 to use only the streamflow component, and it is
  equipped with a Basic Model Interface developed by Rich McDonald (USGS).
